# Problem Statement (Real-Life Context)

A primary healthcare center collects basic health screening data from adults during annual checkups. The objective is to identify individuals at risk of lifestyle diseases (such as diabetes and hypertension) using numerical health indicators.

The healthcare team wants:

    1. Fast numerical computation
    2. Vectorized analysis (no loops)
    3. Summary statistics for decision-making

Why Extend NumPy → Pandas + Visualization
NumPy → efficient numerical computation Pandas → tabular health data management Visualization → clinical and policy-level decision support. This mirrors real healthcare analytics workflows.

# Dataset Description

Each patient record contains:
Column	                   Description
Age	                       Patient age (years)
BMI	                       Body Mass Index
Systolic_BP	               Blood pressure (mmHg)
Fasting_Glucose	           Blood sugar level (mg/dL)

# Implementation
Step 1. Import required libraries, Create Health dataset using Pandas, Convert NumPy Array to DataFrame
Step 2: Summary Statistics
Step 3: Create Risk Columns
Step 4: Overall Risk Flag
Step 5: Visualization
